# osjs

A (satirical) javascript based operating system.

Check it out at [jsos.website](http://jsos.website),
if I'm still paying for the domain.
Otherwise, `npm install && npm run build && npm start`.

I made most of this in around 8 hours
for the [TerribleHack XIII](https://terriblehack.website/) hackathon,
so I didn't include any features you wouldn't notice on a projector,
such as unit tests, tab completion, or documentation.
If you like that sort of thing,
check out [`typesafe-json`](https://github.com/NicholasThrom/typesafe-json) instead.
